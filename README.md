## üì± Features

### ‚úÖ Core Features
- üìç Live vehicle tracking on Google Maps
- ‚öôÔ∏è Real-time simulated sensor data:
  - Engine status (on/off)
  - Door status (open/closed)
  - Speed (km/h)
- üö® In-app alerts for:
  - Overspeeding (> 80 km/h)
  - Door open while moving
  - Engine on/off state changes

### üß™ Simulated IoT Data
- Simulated via background coroutine service
- Configurable data change interval
- Generated speed & statuses using random logic
